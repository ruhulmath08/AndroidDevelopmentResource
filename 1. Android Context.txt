Context:
--------
Context in Android is an interface to global information about an application environment. ... It allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as up-calls for application-level operations such as launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents, etc

As the name suggests, it's the context of current state of the application/object. It lets newly-created objects understand what has been going on. Typically you call it to get information regarding another part of your program (activity and package/application).

You can get the context by invoking getApplicationContext(), getContext(), getBaseContext() or this (when in a class that extends from Context, such as the Application, Activity, Service and IntentService classes).

Typical uses of context:

Creating new objects: Creating new views, adapters, listeners:

TextView tv = new TextView(getContext());
ListAdapter adapter = new SimpleCursorAdapter(getApplicationContext(), ...);
Accessing standard common resources: Services like LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE, SharedPreferences:

context.getSystemService(LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE)
getApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences(*name*, *mode*);
Accessing components implicitly: Regarding content providers, broadcasts, intent

getApplicationContext().getContentResolver().query(uri, ...);
