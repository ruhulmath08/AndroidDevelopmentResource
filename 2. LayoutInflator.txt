There are many system services provided by the android system and one of them is Layout inflater. Just like we inflate air in a balloon with an air pump to give it a shape, similarly we can inflate different views like button, edittext etc through Java code(programmatically) with the help of Layout Inflater. LayoutInflater is mainly used when we have to make our layout dynamically otherwise we can always make static views in XML.
